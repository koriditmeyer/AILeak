                            created LeakAI Cloud and LeakAI Detector to streamline the time-consuming, costly process of
                            detecting leaks in potable water networks. LeakAI Cloud is a secure SaaS solution,
                            accessible anywhere and capable of offline data recording. It records real-time field device
                            data, processes it through machine learning algorithms to identify noise patterns, and
                            enables acoustic correlation orders for precise leak detection. LeakAI Detector is an
                            innovative field device, combining acoustic recording and correlation in a robust, low-cost
                            microcontroller. Together, these tools automate the entire leak detection process, enhancing
                            accuracy and efficiency.</p>

                        <h3>Fast and Accurate Leak Detection</h3>
                        <p>LeakAI offers a fast, accurate, and intelligent solution to water leak detection. Using IoT
                            and AI, it combines LeakAI Cloud and LeakAI Detector for real-time, cloud-based analysis.
                            The in-house developed software allows for off-line data recording and updates when internet
                            connection is re-established. Advanced machine-learning algorithms analyse noise data to
                            locate leaks, while acoustic correlation orders can be sent for further analysis. Paired
                            with any compatible noise recording device, the LeakAI system revolutionizes leak detection,
                            enhancing efficiency and precision.</p>
